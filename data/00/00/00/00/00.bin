  |   Welcome to Chasm, an action-adventure game in which you play a new    |
  |   recruit undertaking your first mission for the Guildean Kingdom.      |
  |   Thrilled to prove your worth as a knight, you track strange rumors    |
  |   that a mine vital to the Kingdom has been shut down. But what you     |
  |   discover in the mining town is worse than you imagined: The           |
  |   townspeople have disappeared, kidnapped by supernatural creatures     |
  |   emerging from the depths.                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Honor-bound to solve the mystery and restore peace to the Kingdom,    |
  |   you embark upon an epic adventure, with deadly battles against        |
  |   cunning monsters, exploration of ancient catacombs and castles, and   |
  |   powerful new equipment hidden at every turn. Though the overall       |
  |   story is the same for all players, your hero's journey will be        |
  |   unique: each of the rooms has been hand-designed, and behind the      |
  |   scenes Chasm stitches these rooms together into a one-of-a-kind       |
  |   world map that will be your own.                                      |
